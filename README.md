An open source Windows 10 Universal App to control Trendnet Cameras

This is a complete re-write of the Windows Phone 8.1 app I wrote last summer -> http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/jctrendnet/4785cc63-cfae-4cc1-a58b-a67c11d06424

Things left before an initial release:
-Ability to manage cameras
-Ability to share camera stills via email/sms
